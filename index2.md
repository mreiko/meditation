Are you interested in meditation but confused about which type is right for you? 

Starting a meditation practice doesn't require anything you don't have right now. Your meditation practice doesn't have to conflict with your current beliefs, it  doesn't require an hour per day to be meaningful, nor does it require a special mindset or super-human discipline. 

Everything you need to start a meditation practice you already have.

# Ready to start?

## Steps to start meditating now:
1. Sit or stand with your spine erect but relaxed.
2. Inhale slowly and count from one to three to yourself. Exhale slowly, counting again.
3. Set a timer for one minute and do this breathing and counting with eyes closed.

Now if anyone asks you if you're ever meditated, you can respond with a resounding yes! Is it really that simple? Yes. 

## Why Do People Pay to Meditate?
It's not always a scam. It's free to meditate, yes, but it's no different than a personal trainer. You could find all that information online and build a DIY program. It's the guidance and accountability that people pay for and meditation is no different.

## Tools to Form a Daily Habit

### Healthy Minds App
Developed by world-renowned neuroscientist Dr. Richard Davidson and his team at the Center for Healthy Minds at the University of Wisconsin - Madison & Healthy Minds Innovations, the Healthy Minds Program trains your mind through meditation and podcast-style lessons to develop skills - to gain focus, reduce stress, and maintain positive social connections. The app uses neuroscience, contemplative traditions, and skill-based learning methods to help you develop the skills for a healthy mind, now in the palm of your hand. Translating pioneering neuroscience into tools for everyday life, our unique framework guides you through the four pillars of the science of training the mind.

Pros: Free, your participation contributes to research
Cons: Creation of new material might be slow once you get through the current program
